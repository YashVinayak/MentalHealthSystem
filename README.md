# MentalHealthSystem

The purpose of creating this project is to create awareness among people facing challeneges of any sort of mental health.

We Created a website with all basic functionality and a chatbot is deployed which asks the guest user to take a small test having few different questions.

According to the responses given by the user the chatbot tells whether they should visit a doctor or not.

The bot after this gives a link which redirects the user to a login page where the user after signing up can login 
and view the list of cities we are currently operational in.

Corresponding to the city selected a list of doctors comes on the screen which shows Doctor's name,Qualification,
Years of Experience,Hospital Address and Contact Number.


Please refer to 'instruction' file to open the project.
